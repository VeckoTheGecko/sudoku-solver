# Sudoku Solver
A sudoku solver with a GUI that allows a user to enter in a partially completed board, and the board is solved using a backrtacking algorithm.

This branch is dedicated to an object oriented approach (as mentioned in the bellow video). The code can be run by going into the root directory and running `python src/sudoku.py`.
